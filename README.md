# Object-Oriented-School-Management-System
A feature-rich School Management System built using C++ and OOP principles. It handles student and teacher records, course enrollment, fee tracking, and admin operations with secure login and dynamic memoryâ€”all through a clean, console-based interface.
This project simulates real-world school operations such as enrollment, authentication, course management, fee tracking, and teacher salaries. It applies core OOP concepts including:

- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Dynamic Memory Allocation
- Modularity
